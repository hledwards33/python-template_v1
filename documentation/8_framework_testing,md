We are using pytest to write the unit tests for this repository

Testing principles
For unit tests, it’s a good rule of thumb to remember that tests should always follow the common “arrange / act / assert” structure. That is to say, we should:

arrange everything that is needed for the test, like creating any necessary data or special settings, preparing an in-memory database, or mocking API calls;

act on the function or method to be tested by calling it;

assert the expected outcome.
